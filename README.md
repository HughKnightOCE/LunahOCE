## Overview

This repository contains a collection of cybersecurity-related projects developed by Hugh Knight. These projects demonstrate a range of skills in areas such as network security, password management, and file integrity verification.

## Projects

### Network Sentinel

A Python-based network scanner that identifies active hosts and open ports on a local network.

* **Features:**
    * Performs ARP scans to discover devices on the network.
    * Sends ICMP echo requests (pings) to check host availability.
    * Conducts port scanning to identify open ports and services.
* **Technologies Used:** Python, Scapy library
* **Purpose:** To enhance network security assessments by providing a tool for identifying potential vulnerabilities.

### Local Password Manager

A Python application for securely storing and retrieving user passwords.

* **Features:**
    * Stores passwords for various websites and services.
    * Encrypts sensitive data using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme.
    * Protects the encryption key using the PBKDF2HMAC key derivation function.
    * Provides a command-line interface for adding, viewing, and editing passwords.
* **Technologies Used:** Python, Fernet, hashlib
* **Purpose**: To secure login credentials.

### File Integrity Verifier

A Python application that scans a directory of files and compares their hashes against a database of known malware hashes.

* **Features:**
    * Calculates MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes of files.
    * Compares calculated hashes against a database of known malware hashes.
    * Reports any matches, indicating potential malware.
    * Logs errors encountered during file access.
* **Technologies Used:** Python, hashlib
* **Purpose:** To detect potentially malicious files by verifying their integrity.
